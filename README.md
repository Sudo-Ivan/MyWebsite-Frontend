# MyWebsite-Frontend WIP

## Hello Everyone! 
## This is my frontend portion of my new website. I am still working on it, but decided to make it public.

#### My plans:

1. Add interactive terminal where you can type ```sudo Ivan``` and it will display varius options to explore about my background and skills. 
2. Fix OpenGraph.
3. Add projects, hire-me, portfolio and store. 
4. Improve code quality, security and privacy.


#### I currently use IONOS Deploy to build and serve my site statically.
